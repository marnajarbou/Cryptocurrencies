# Cryptocurrencies
UsingÂ unsupervised machine learning methods to examine cryptocurrency data

## Overview of Project
In order to better understand how cryptocurrencies should be categorized to produce classifications for constructing an investment product, this research employs machine learning to identify which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market. As there is no known output for what I'm looking for, unsupervised machine learning was chosen. The cryptocurrency were also grouped using a clustering method to help me decide whether or not to invest in this product.
